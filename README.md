# Markov-Game-Model
Replying simulations for the research article "Markov Game Modeling of Moving Target Defense for Strategic Detection of Threats in Cloud Networks" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09660)

In order to run this similation you will need to install Gurobi solver. Gurobi comes with a free academic license and can be installed into anaconda in 3 simple steps (see [this link](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/8.0/quickstart_mac/installing_the_anaconda_py.html)).

Once Gurobi is properly installed, you may try the simulation running `simulation.py` from the `./src` folder
